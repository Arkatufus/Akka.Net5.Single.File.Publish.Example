# Akka.Net .NET 5.0 Single File Publish Example

An example of how to do a Net5.0 single file publish of an Akka.Net project.
This example uses the simple Akka.Remote chat server/client example from the Akka.Net Github repository.

To build:
- Inside Visual Studio 2019, right click on the server/client project name in the solution explorer and click `Publish`. 
- Under the `Publish` tab, click on the `Publish` button on the top of the page.
- The published single file executable should be built in `\bin\publish`
- Run both the client and server program in the command console or powershell to make sure that they work as intended.
